# ft_printf

project in school 42

create a function that imitates ```printf``` in ```<stdio.h>```

pass with 111 / 115 (deepthought gave me 112)

This works with the following flags :

```-``` ```+``` ``` ``` (space) ```#``` ```0```

The precision ```.```

The ```*```

The length ```l``` ```ll``` ```h``` ```hh```

and the following conversions :
```cspdiuxX%nf```

In fact, there were some faults for ```%f```, but deepthought still accepted this, so it'll probably accept different answers caused by floating error in C (more information : search IEEE-754).

Hence, don't be afraid to try out ```%f``` ```%g``` and ```%e``` (I regret that I didn't submit ```%g``` and ```%e``` because they didn't pass some online testers, deepthought can be less strict than that)

Good luck for this project :)
